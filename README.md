# Fourth-Wall
DESCRIPTION:
A compact, portable productivity companion inspired by ORV, featuring a touch OLED screen that displays animated characters and lets users set custom timers for study or workout sessions, log brief memos, and receive break remindersâ€”all stored locally and packed into a stylish, Fourth Wall-themed case.

INSPIRATION:
The inspiration for this project came from my love of Omniscient Readerâ€™s Viewpoint (ORV) and my need for a practical tool to help me stay focused. I wanted a dedicated device that could track my study and workout sessions, manage breaks, and let me jot down quick notes, without the distractions of my phone. By building this portable, ORV-themed timer and note taker, I can reduce screen time while making productivity a bit more fun and personal.
