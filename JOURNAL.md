I started this project!!! I regularly use my notes app and wanted to make it look better. Moreover, I also keep on catching myself on my phone when I'm supposed to be studying, which is why i need a proper study timer. Hence, why I created a pocket-sized timer and notes-storage device. I made it ORV (Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint) themed, because ORV is my favorite novel!
Today, I just drafted two designs for the case, came up with the description for my project, and also the BOM.

I worked on the schematic with some of the components that I will need. I probably will edit this in the future because I need to add other components or may have made some errors, so I need to double check. This took time since I had to watch new tutorials on LCD and understand the errors.

I started working on the CAD today I got a lot of the work done, mainly on the outer parts of the casing. This took a lot of time because I was trying to figure out how to make the stacked paper layers. I was using a reference image which is also below.
