I started this project!!! I regularly use my notes app and wanted to make it look better. Moreover, I also keep on catching myself on my phone when I'm supposed to be studying, which is why i need a proper study timer. Hence, why I created a pocket-sized timer and notes-storage device. I made it ORV (Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint) themed, because ORV is my favorite novel!
Today, I just drafted two designs for the case, came up with the description for my project, and also the BOM.
